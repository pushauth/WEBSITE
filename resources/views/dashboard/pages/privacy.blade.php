                                            <p>Privacy and online safety are important to Stripe. We offer a software platform and services for helping run an internet business. We collect data about businesses and their customers (“<strong>Data</strong>”) when they use the platform, the services, and our websites (collectively, “<strong>Services</strong>”). This privacy policy describes how we collect, use and disclose Data. </p>

                                            <p>In this privacy policy, we sometimes refer to “You”. “<strong>You</strong>” may be a visitor to one of our websites, a user of one or more of our Services (<strong>“User”</strong>), or a customer of a User (<strong>“Customer”</strong>). We’ll do our best to clarify who we are referring to at various points in the policy. This policy does not apply to third-party websites, products, or services even if they link to our Services, and You should consider the privacy practices of those third-parties carefully. If You disagree with the practices described in this policy, You should (a) take the necessary steps to remove cookies from Your computer after leaving our website, and (b) discontinue Your use of our Services. Finally, we have also put together a <a href="/cookies-policy/legal">Cookie Policy</a> that describes in detail how we use cookies and similar technologies.</p>

                                            <h3 id="overview">1. Overview<a class="anchor" href="#overview"></a></h3>

                                            <p>The Data we collect depends on how our Services are used. Sometimes we receive Data directly, such as when a Stripe account is created, test transactions are submitted through our website, the <a href="https://stripe.com/checkout">Stripe Checkout</a> form is used, or we receive an email. Other times, we get Data by recording interactions with our Services by, for example, using technologies like cookies and web beacons. We also get Data from third parties, like our financial partners or identity verification services. </p>

                                            <p>The collection and use of data from a variety of sources is essential to our ability to provide our Services – and to help keep the Services safe. Data is critical in helping us to increase the safety of Your online payments, and reduce the risk of fraud, money laundering and other harmful activity.</p>

                                            <p><strong>a. Personal Data.</strong> We call Data that identifies, or that could reasonably be used to identify, You as an individual <strong>“Personal Data”</strong>. We collect Personal Data in different ways. For example, we collect Personal Data when a business registers for a Stripe account, a Customer makes payments or conducts transactions through a User’s website or application, a person responds to Stripe emails or surveys, or when a Customer uses the “Remember Me” feature of Stripe Checkout. We also receive Personal Data from other sources, such as our partners, financial service providers, identity verification services, and publicly available sources. Personal Data does not include Data that has been aggregated or made anonymous such that it can no longer be reasonably associated with a specific person.  The Personal Data that we may collect includes:</p>

                                            <ul>

                                                <li><strong>Cookie and tracking technology data</strong>, such as time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data; and</li>
                                                <li><strong>Company data</strong>, such as a company’s legal structure, product and service offerings, jurisdiction, company records, and information submitted through the <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">Stripe Atlas</a> service.</li>
                                            </ul>

Examples of how we may use Personal Data include: </p>

                                            <p><strong>b. Other Data.</strong> We may use Other Data for a range of different purposes, provided we comply with applicable law and our contractual commitments. In some countries (for example, European Economic Area countries), local legal regimes may require us to treat some or all of Other Data as “personal data” under applicable data protection laws. Where this is the case, we will process Other Data only for the same purposes as Personal Data under this privacy policy. </p>

To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie, or similar tracking technology, on Your browser (including the use of pixel tags). They may also use these technologies, along with data they collect about Your online use, to recognize You across the devices You use, such as a mobile phone and a laptop, and to make decisions about the advertisements You see.

Those advertising networks may recognize the web beacon or cookie associated with Your visit to our website when You visit other websites on which they serve advertising, and they may make decisions about the advertisements You see based on it. We may choose to work with Google AdWords, Doubleclick, AdRoll or other advertising networks. Each of these companies has its own privacy policy, which we encourage You to review. For more information about advertising and tracking online, visit the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative</a>.
